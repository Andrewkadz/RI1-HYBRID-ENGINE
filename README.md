# RI1-HYBRID-ENGINE
Groundbreaking open-source AI folding together neuro-symbolic reasoning, multimodal generation (text, code, images, music, scientific signals), and agentic orchestration, built for privacy-first, transparent intelligence with Rust and Windsurf.

# RI1 Hybrid Generative Engine

**Neuro-Symbolic Multimodal Generative AI — Built in Rust by RI1**

Welcome to the future of open-source intelligence: RI1 Hybrid Generative Engine fuses advanced neuro-symbolic reasoning with dynamic multimodal creativity—spanning text, code, images, music, VR/EEG signals, and specialized data. Designed from the ground up for maximal transparency, privacy-first operation, and agentic orchestration, the engine empowers both research and creative innovation.

## Vision
- **Constraint-aware Generation:** Outputs guided by mathematical, scientific, and philosophical rules.
- **Multimodal Creativity:** Native support for text, images, code, music/audio, and signal data.
- **Symbolic-Agent Architecture:** Modular agents (Φ, Λ, Ξ, Δ, Ψ) collaborate, negotiate, and explain results.
- **Local-First, Privacy-Centric:** Run fully offline, edge-compatible and free from vendor lock-in.
- **Extensible by Design:** Plug in new modalities, rulesets, or agents without disrupting core infrastructure.

## Technical Highlights
- Written 100% in **Rust** — robust, performant, and secure.
- Built for **Windsurf IDE** workflows with deep Cascade agent integration.
- Modular Cargo workspace; includes CLI, API, and demo applications.
- Pluggable constraint engine (math, logic, ethics, user-defined).
- Open roadmap and transparency logs for all generation phases.
